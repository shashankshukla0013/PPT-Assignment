    "# ANSWERS\n",
    "1. Feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) involves extracting meaningful features from input images. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image, detecting patterns, edges, and textures. These learned features are progressively extracted, capturing hierarchical representations as the network deepens. Pooling layers then downsample the extracted features, reducing spatial dimensions while preserving important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backpropagation in computer vision tasks is the process of updating the weights of the neural network based on the computed gradient of the loss function. In computer vision, the loss function compares the predicted output of the network with the ground truth. The gradient is calculated using the chain rule, propagating the error from the output layer back to the network's earlier layers. This allows the network to learn and adjust its parameters to minimize the difference between predictions and ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transfer learning in CNNs offers benefits such as faster training and improved performance. Pre-trained models trained on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) capture general image features that are transferable to other tasks. By initializing a CNN with pre-trained weights, the network already has knowledge of low-level features. Fine-tuning is then performed by retraining the network on a smaller task-specific dataset, allowing the network to adapt and learn task-specific features while leveraging the pre-trained knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data augmentation techniques in CNNs involve artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing images. Techniques include random rotations, translations, flips, zooming, and adjusting brightness or contrast. Data augmentation improves model generalization, reduces overfitting, and helps the model learn robust features by exposing it to a wider range of variations and scenarios during training.\n",
